# Analysis of mobile application user behavior
## Status
Finished
## Tasks
1. To provide recommendations for modifying certain stages of the sales funnel of a mobile food delivery app
2. To determine whether the idea of changing the fonts in the app is viable
## Results
1. Large percantage of users is lost while trying to go from Main Screen to Offers Screen, thus, some theories of what could cause the problem and the ways to resolve it are proposed.
2. A/A/b-test showed there were no statistically significant diffirences in users' behaviour after the fonts were changed.
