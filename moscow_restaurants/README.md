# Research of the catering market in Moscow
## Status
Finished
## Goal
To determine whether the business idea of opening a small cafe in Moscow, in which visitors are attended by robots, is viable in the long run and, if yes, to give recommendations on the most advantageous kind, size, and location of this cateing facility
## Results
It is better to open a cafe with a small seating area in order to save on rent, since the project is already expensive (and robots are likely to be able to attend visitors more efficiently due to the lack of a human factor, also the cafe will be able to work on a take-away basis as well) in the central districts of Moscow in order to reach a more diverse audience, but at the same time on a street with a relatively small number of catering facilities in order to avoid high competition.
